Webdesign-"Friends" Themed
Greetings to the Judging Panel.
This is the final submission for WEBMASTER,TECH FEST SVCE by Sai Raksha Venkatesh--IT-B (3rd Year).
I am a self taught UI/UX designer and have a passion for backend tech. 
                                    ***********
Tech Specs:
I have used HTML 5,CSS 3 AND Slight bootstrap for additional features, Brackets Editor was used as Source Code Editor.
I have also used fonts,icons from templates on the internet(templates for navbar customization and symbols[girl,boy,insta-send etc,])-Seen in the footer due to imports.
The code-language proportions are present in the repository as well.
Here is the link to my Github page: https://sai-raksha.github.io/TECH-FEST-WEBMASTER/index.html
Works best on 90% zoom desktop browser settings.
The graphic design of the website was completely created by me unless otherwise stated.
Sources of images are from the web from multiple pages and the credits solely go to the "Friends" Crew and Creators of the Images. No Credits claimed.

About the Website:
Friends is a series we all love. But there are still people who havent experienced the essence of the show. 
This webpages's motive is to convince one to watch the series and have fun!
It is more like a fanmade page to support my arguments on why its worth watching the series.
Hope you enjoy.
